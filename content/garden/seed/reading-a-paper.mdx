# Reading a paper

## Why would you want to read a scientific article?

In her article ["How to take notes while reading a book"](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-take-notes-while-reading-a-book), Anne-Laure outlines a few things to consider when taking notes. The first of which is **why** are you taking notes?

When I consume scientific papers, I can be approaching them with a number of intentions:

* reading for **comprehension** (generally core research papers that I am analysing as a basis for an essay or premise)
* reading for **corroboration** (generally when I have a core set of research papers and I have followed various references from them to assess supporting or refuting research)
* reading to **translate** (usually if I am wanting to be able to create a [[lay summary]] or review of the paper content)
* reading for **lit reviews or [[meta analyses]]** (similar to reading to translate - but also noting the signposting of additional references that might become core or corroborative material)

## Ideas to help
* Use [[pdf annotation]]
* Organise [[scientific references]]
* Keep a definition [[glossary]]
* Check out [[connected papers]]
