# (Wu and Cline 1998) Stabilization of Dendritic Arbor Structure in Vivo by CaMKII

- [x] summarise
- [x] critical analysis

---

## Title

---

### What was studied?

The stability of the [[dendritic arbor]] structure

### What was the method?

Through application of [[CaMKII]]

### What was the context?

In the laboratory - [[in vivo]]

---

## Abstract

---

### Why did this research take place?

To find out whether [[CaMKII]] controls the physical maturing of neurons of the [[optic tectum]] in frogs.

We already know that it controls the physical maturation of the [[retinotectal]] [[glutamatergic]] [[synapse]]s.

### How did they study/research this topic - what were their methods?

They raised [[CaMKII]] activity in neurons through [[viral expression]] of CaMKII with [[constitutive activity]] 

### What were their main findings?

Dendritic ([[dendrite]]) growth was slowed in young neurons to a rate comparable with mature neurons. 

### What is the main message?

[[endogenous]] CaMKII activity limits dendritic growth and stabilises dendrites, whereas CaMKII inhition increases dendritic growth.

## Introduction

---

### What is the relevant previous work that this was built on?

* brain development is fueled by neuronal growth
* promotion and limitation of neural growth is controlled by a number of mechanisms
* neuronal activity and the resulting calcium can decrease the growth of neurons
* CaMKII is a calcium-sensitive enzyme and can inflence both neuronal growth and synaptic efficacy
* CaMKII is concentrated in [[postsynaptic-density]]s with a wide range of substrates - transmitter receptors, channel proteins and cytoskeletal proteins
* the wide range of substrates means that CaMKII *could* translate input into coordinated changes in neuronal growth and synaptic strength
* CaMKII expression and [[subcellular localisation]] are regulated by brain development
* postsynaptic increases of CaMKII activity influences development of [[presynaptic]] [[retinotectal]] axons and the maturing of the retinotectal synaptic responses

### What niche does this work fill?

* it is not clear whether the effect that CaMKII has on neuronal growth and synaptic efficacy is coordinated

### What are the aims/hypotheses? (starting with the **main** one)

* dendritic growth may be controlled by a calcium-mediated mechanism (like CaMKII)
* CaMKII may coordinate the development of synaptic functions and neuronal [[morphology]]

## Methods

### What are the details of the sample?

### Are there ethical considerations?

### What materials were used?

KN-93
: The molecule KN-93 is the most widely used inhibitor for studying the cellular and in vivo functions of CaMKII. It is widely believed that KN-93 binds directly to CaMKII, thus preventing kinase activation by competing with Ca2+/CaM.

### What was the experimental design?

* to establish the baseline of *physical development of tectal neurons* they DiI-labelled single cells at various positions along the front-back axis of the tectum, and then collected [[confocal]] images of each neuron's complete structure over 3-5 days in order to analyse the complexity of the dendritic trees.
* to test whether *increased CaMKII activity has an impact on dendritic tree development* they DiI-labelled single cells at various positions along the front-back axis of the tectum, and then collected confocal images of each neuron over 3 days starting before infection with [[viral expression]] in some of the neurons (other neurons were left uninfected or infected with a control enzyme (beta galactosidase)) and then they analysed the growth rate of each neuron over this period.
* to test whether *CaMKII stabilises the dendritic tree growth/retraction* they took observations of uninfected and CaMKII infected neurons at 2 hour intervals over 6 hours and analysed each neuron on the lifecycle length of the dendritic branches as well as the number of branches grown/retracted in that period.
* to test the *role of [[endogenous]] CaMKII activity in dendritic tree development* KN-93 was used to inhibit CaMKII functioning and the dendritic branch length was assessed in both simple and complex neurons for significant change over a 3 day period.

**Enzyme demonstrates key influence over how neurons grow**
*Internal CaMKII activity controls dendrite growth and is shown to translate high levels of sensory input into more stable neuronal structures and lower levels of activity into neuronal growth*

The optic tectum plays a primary role in transforming vision and motor sensory input in the brain. Research into how the neurons that develop in this part of the brain shows that there are three main stages in the neuron lifecycle:
