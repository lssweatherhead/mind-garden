# (Wu and Cline 1998) Stabilization of Dendritic Arbor Structure in Vivo by CaMKII

- [x] summarise
- [x] critical analysis

---

## Title

---

### What was studied?

The stabilisation of the [[dendritic arbor]] structure

### What was the method?

Through application of [[CaMKII]]

### What was the context?

In the laboratory - [[in vivo]]

---

## Abstract

---

### Why did this research take place?

To find out whether [[CaMKII]] controls the physical maturing of neurons of the [[optic tectum]] in frogs, as well as those of the [[retinotectal]] [[glutamatergic]] [[synapse]]s

### How did they study/research this topic - what were their methods?

They raised [[CaMKII]] activity in neurons through [[viral expression]] of CaMKII with [[constitutive activity]] 

### What were their main findings?

Dendritic ([[dendrite]]) growth was slowed in young neurons to a rate comparable with mature neurons. 

### What is the main message?

CaMKII activity limits dendritic growth and stabilises dendrites
