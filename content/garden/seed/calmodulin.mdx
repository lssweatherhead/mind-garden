# Calmodulin (CaM)

This is an intermediate calcium-binding messenger protein.

It is an intracellular target of the secondary messenger Ca2+, and the binding of Ca2+ is required for the activation of Calmodulin. Once bound to Ca2+, Calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction pathway by modifying its interactions with various target proteins, such as kinases like [[CaMKII]].
