# Afferent (nerves/neurons)

* Neurons that receive information from our sensory organs (e.g. eye, skin) and transmit this input to the central nervous system are called afferent neurons.

* Nerves that carry signals toward the central nervous system from the periphery. Afferent may also be used generally to describe nerves that are traveling into a nervous system structure (i.e. input fibers for a particular area as opposed to output fibers).
