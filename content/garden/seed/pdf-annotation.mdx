# PDF Annotation

Such as [Kami App](https://www.kamiapp.com/) - allows commenting, highlighting and a bunch of other stuff. Free! Handy Chrome plugin and reads from Google drive nicely, so easy to organise all your papers.

Also use [Liquid Text](https://www.liquidtext.net/) on my ipad - also allows commenting, highlighting etc, but not free for the more advanced (useful) features ðŸ˜¢ Good experience though.
