# Efferent (nerves/neurons)

* Neurons that send impulses from the central nervous system to your limbs and organs are called efferent neurons.

* Nerves that carry information away from the central nervous system, to the peripheral nervous system. Efferent may also be used generally to describe nerves that are leaving a nervous system structure (i.e. output fibers for a particular area as opposed to input fibers).
