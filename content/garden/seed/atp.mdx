# ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)

ATP – or Adenosine Triphosphate – is the primary energy carrier in all living organisms on earth. ... When the cell requires energy, ATP is broken down through hydrolysis. The high energy bond is broken and a phosphoryl group is removed. The energy released from this process is used to drive various cellular processes.
