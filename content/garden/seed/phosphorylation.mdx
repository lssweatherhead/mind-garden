# Phosphorylation

Phosphorylation is an important mechanism by which the activity of proteins can be altered after they are formed. A phosphate group ( PO3âˆ’4 ) is added to a protein by specific enzymes called kinases. This phosphate group is usually provided by [[ATP]], the energy carrier of the cell.
