# Subcellular localisation

Protein subcellular localization prediction (or just protein localization prediction) involves the prediction of where a protein resides in a cell, its subcellular localisation. The aim is to build tools that can accurately predict the outcome of protein targeting in cells.

## Why is protein localisation important?

As such, subcellular localization influences protein function by controlling access to and availability of all types of molecular interaction partners. Thus, knowledge of protein localization often plays a significant role in characterizing the cellular function of hypothetical and newly discovered proteins
