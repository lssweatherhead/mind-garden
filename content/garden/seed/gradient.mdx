# Gradient

## What is a gradient?

In the developing brain, gradients are commonly used to divide neurogenic regions into distinct functional domains. Examples of such gradients are the sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient responsible for specifying dorsoventral fates in the spinal cord (Ericson et al. 1997), and the double inverted gradients of the transcription factors En1/2 and Pax2/5, induced by morphogens secreted from the isthmic organizer that pattern the midbrain and hindbrain

## Rostrocaudal (rostral - caudal)

In anatomy, along the long (head-to-tail) axis of the body, or the front (rostral) to back (caudal) of the brain
