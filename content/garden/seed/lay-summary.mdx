# Lay summary

A lay summary, or impact statement, is a very efficient way of conveying the essence of an article briefly and clearly. 

Fundamentally, what you’re aiming to produce is a short paragraph outlining the article content, aimed at "lay people" in the field and written in a way that can be easily understood.

## Structure should answer main questions:
* who did the research?
* what did they look at? What was their premise/hypothesis?
* where was their focus? What area?
* when did they do the research?
* how many: results? Hypotheses? Experiment repeats?
* why is this important?

## Things to keep in mind

→ justify the research and why it is important

→ give background and context - what prompted the need for it?

→ follow a logical order, not necessary the sequence outlined in the paper

→ use succinct, short sentences and write in plain english

→ avoid jargon if possible - explain it if it's needed

→ use first person and active voice: if you can add "by zombies" to the end of the sentence then you are using the passive voice. e.g. "we agreed" vs "it was agreed" (by zombies)

→ use positive sentences rather than negative ones

→ images are important! Try to use one if you can
