# Dendrite

The branched projections of a [[neuron]] along which impulses received from neurons at synapses are transmitted to the cell body. Dendrites are appendages that are designed to receive communications from other cells. They resemble a tree-like structure, forming projections that become stimulated by other neurons and conduct the electrochemical charge to the cell body (or, more rarely, directly to the axons).
