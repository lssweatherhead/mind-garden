# Dendritic arbor

The branching arrangement of the dendrites of a neuron.

Dendritic arbor (isation), also known as dendritic branching, is a multi-step biological process by which [[neuron]]s form new dendritic trees and branches to create new [[synapse]]s. The morphology of [[dendrite]]s such as branch density and grouping patterns are highly correlated to the function of the neuron.
