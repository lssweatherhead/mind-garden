# DiI ("Dye Aye")

DiI, pronounced like Dye Aye, also known as DiIC18(3), is a fluorescent lipophilic cationic indocarbocyanine dye which is usually made as a perchlorate salt. It is used for scientific staining purposes such as single molecule imaging, fate mapping, electrode marking and neuronal tracing (as DiI is retained in the lipid bilayers).
